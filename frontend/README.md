# DeerFlow Frontend

Like the original DeerFlow 1.0, we would love to give the community a minimalistic and easy-to-use web interface with a more modern and flexible architecture.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) with [App Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app)
- **UI**: [React 19](https://react.dev/), [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/), [Shadcn UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/), [MagicUI](https://magicui.design/) and [React Bits](https://reactbits.dev/)
- **AI Integration**: [LangGraph SDK](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@langchain/langgraph-sdk) and [Vercel AI Elements](https://vercel.com/ai-sdk/ai-elements)

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 22+
- pnpm 10.26.2+

### Installation

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration
```

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev

# The app will be available at http://localhost:3000
```

### Build & Test

```bash
# Type check
pnpm typecheck

# Check formatting
pnpm format

# Apply formatting
pnpm format:write

# Lint
pnpm lint

# Run unit tests
pnpm test

# One-time setup: install Playwright Chromium browser
pnpm exec playwright install chromium

# Run E2E tests (builds and starts production server automatically)
pnpm test:e2e

# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start
```

## Site Map

```
├── /                    # Landing page
├── /chats               # Chat list
├── /chats/new           # New chat page
└── /chats/[thread_id]   # A specific chat page
```

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

Key environment variables (see `.env.example` for full list):

```bash
# Backend API URL (optional, uses local Next.js/nginx proxy by default)
NEXT_PUBLIC_BACKEND_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8001"
# LangGraph-compatible API URL (optional, uses local Next.js/nginx proxy by default)
NEXT_PUBLIC_LANGGRAPH_BASE_URL="http://localhost:8001/api"
```

When these URLs point directly at the Gateway, browser auth calls and LangGraph
ordinary/SSE requests use that origin with credentials. Add the exact frontend
origin to `GATEWAY_CORS_ORIGINS`. The current double-submit CSRF cookies support
same-host splits such as `localhost:3000` → `localhost:8001`; a different
hostname requires an explicit cookie/CSRF deployment design.

## Development Notes

- Uses pnpm workspaces (see `packageManager` in package.json)
- Turbopack enabled by default in development for faster builds
- Environment validation can be skipped with `SKIP_ENV_VALIDATION=1` (useful for Docker)
- Backend API URLs are optional; nginx proxy is used by default in development
- Thread history renders the backend `display.visible_in_chat` contract; internal
  task, tool, middleware, and subagent rows stay persisted for run history but
  are hidden from chat bubbles.
- Thread reload rebuilds visible history from real per-run message endpoints and
  continues through older runs while visible messages are being restored.
- Reload recovery first uses the backend thread runtime snapshot, which bundles
  runs, latest per-run message pages, native round state, and task lanes; task
  lanes restore subtask terminal state even when task-event rows are missing
  from the first message page.
- The backend run list is newest-first with deterministic tie-breaks; reload
  history relies on that order before sorting messages by each run's local
  `seq`.
- If a resumable stream disconnects after a run id is known, the UI keeps that
  run busy and probes for the terminal state instead of clearing the chat as
  finished; the transient stream error is hidden from the input state while
  recovery is still responsible for that run.
- If that bounded probe later gives up or receives a permanent auth/not-found
  response, the UI clears local fake streaming ownership and refreshes run and
  thread lists instead of waiting forever.
- If the latest terminal run has no visible AI reply, the chat shows a terminal
  notice instead of silently rendering an empty assistant turn.
