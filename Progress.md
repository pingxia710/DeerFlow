# Progress

## 2026-07-22 — NextOS Round 002 recursion pre-diagnosis completed

- A read-only comparison of the five Round 002 Chair Runs and the Round 001
  failing root Run identified a Command Room entry-path budget split. The
  browser root Run explicitly requested `recursion_limit=1000`; background
  wake requests persisted no override, and the current Gateway
  `build_run_config()` therefore resolves them to the generic default `100`.
  The two failing wake Runs both reported that exact limit.
- The failed traces kept making forward progress through result comparison,
  card/DECK closure, report writing, Goal Workspace write-back, and inbox
  acknowledgement. Neither trace contained a `loop_warning`. This supports the
  entry-path split as the narrow direct fault condition; it does not prove that
  `1000` is a permanent stability guarantee or that no deeper efficiency issue
  remains.
- Corrected an earlier wake fact: terminally failed Chair wakes are retried up
  to three attempts. The 002-03 lane records `attempts=3`, matching two
  recursion errors followed by the successful final wake. Persistence and a
  successful retry limited state loss, but do not establish recovery
  reliability.
- The two failed Runs consumed 1,376,609 raw Run Ledger tokens, 39.36% of the
  Round 002 total. The proposed next route is therefore one semantic alignment
  of the existing Command Room default, a focused check, and one L1
  task-to-wake closure regression before parallel cards, multi-result INBOX, or
  delegation A/B work resumes. Opposition independently reached the same
  conclusion.
- Evidence and the proposed route are recorded in Obsidian at `[[Round 002
  递归异常诊断]]` and the current `[[PLAN]]`. This checkpoint changed no code,
  Prompt, Skill, tests, service configuration, recursion limit, live runtime,
  or external system.

## 2026-07-22 — NextOS 2.0 Round 002 calibration re-verification executed

- Executed the isolated L1 sequence `002-01 → 002-02 → 002-03` in thread
  `2df24542-9806-485d-a794-b5e3d08a281d`. All three cards converged. The
  strict T5 trajectory is now evidenced: the never-dispatched 002-03 v1/alpha
  card was preserved byte-for-byte, the active card was amended to v2/beta
  with the 002-02 task/result causal reference before any receipt, a later
  Chair Run recovered the revised state, and T7 dispatched v2 exactly once.
- The Round 001 anomaly audit kept the required boundary: the visible
  `GraphRecursionError` and bounded recovery facts are documented, but root
  cause, a fix, automatic wake causality, exactly-once internals, and general
  runtime stability remain unproven. During Round 002 closure, two consecutive
  wake/reporting Runs again reached recursion limit 100; persisted carriers
  allowed a later Run to finish the DECK, report, and inbox acknowledgement.
- Final runtime facts after quiescence: 5 Chair Runs (3 success, 2 recursion
  errors), 107 LLM calls, 3,497,414 aggregate Run Ledger tokens, and about
  34m56s wall time. Three child results were all effectively used (3/3),
  execution-time Owner interruptions were 0, the scripted T6 recovery check
  was 1/1 with no key fact error, and delegation quality gain remains unmeasured.
  The internal completion report conservatively left token cost unmeasured;
  the value above is the post-quiescence raw `runs.total_tokens` sum.
- Evidence: `rounds/002/Round-002-完成报告.md`, the final DECK, all three
  artifacts, the preserved v1 card, and result sequences 232/235/240 in the
  thread Goal Workspace. Inbox acknowledgement and notification both reached
  seq 240. No repo code, Prompt, Skill, test, service configuration, or
  recursion limit changed; no service restart or external message occurred.

## 2026-07-22 — NextOS 2.0 Round 001 first rehearsal executed

- Executed T-1 through T8 against the current local runtime, preserving the
  existing dirty worktree. The card-contract close is supported by the Goal
  Workspace evidence: A re-evaluated after Brief v2; A2's no-evidence claim
  was rejected and repaired; B's first overreaching report was preserved and
  corrected in the same card; the final Chair verification passed.
- The runtime's first root Run hit its recursion limit and was recovered by a
  later Chair Run from persistent Goal Workspace records; no code or runtime
  configuration was changed to mask it. The strict script also lacks a
  separate recorded T5 case that changes B's assumptions and amends B before
  dispatch. Record the round as card-contract complete, but not as a clean
  four-fault rehearsal pass.
- Evidence lives in the isolated Goal Workspace under Round 001, including
  `T0-完成报告.md`, `T0-goal-workspace-carriers.md`, and the preserved/corrected
  B reports. No business or production write occurred. The local Gateway used
  its existing configured model providers to execute the exercise; no external
  messages were sent.

## 2026-07-22 — NextOS 2.0 Round 1 T-1 prompt and Skill sync

- Synced the missing sealed semantics from Obsidian `NextOS-2.0/wiki/Chair
  prompt 刷新稿.md` into the existing Chair runtime prompt and
  `nextos-commander` method card: five-step Run contract, four direct-work
  kinds, contract-able card dispatch and amendment, evidence-bearing child
  contracts, per-Run result reconciliation, intent receipts, and the plain
  language/four-human-gate protocol. The existing C5 mandatory Opposition rule
  was already present and was retained.
- Scope stayed text-only in the runtime prompt and Chair Skill, with matching
  focused prompt/Skill assertions; no program logic, transport, persistence, or
  frozen program-boundary rule changed. Existing uncommitted work outside this
  T-1 text sync was preserved.
- Verification: the compact runtime-prompt body measured 11,399 characters
  (a performance fact, not a gate); `git diff --check`; 59 focused prompt,
  role-package, and task tests passed (2 deselected pre-existing unrelated
  version assertions); and capability snapshot, task transport, and background
  wake coverage passed 54 tests (one upstream deprecation warning). T-1 itself
  is not Round 1 success evidence; T0 begins only after this record.

## 2026-07-22 — C5 opposition rule rolled out to runtime prompt and Skill

- Follow-through of the authorized C5 change: the mandatory Opposition
  rule (new root goal / substantially new or revised plan / material
  route change) is now also in `lead_agent/prompt.py` (Chair runtime
  prompt) and `skills/custom/nextos-commander/` SKILL.md (two spots)
  and AGENTS.md (charter), matching the earlier root/backend AGENTS.md
  edits. Codex final review verified the rollout.
- The same review's four factual corrections were applied to the
  NextOS 2.0 knowledge base: card_id uses a zero-code description
  prefix scheme (no handoff_json claim); lane.result limit is ~4000
  chars; natural results are not auto-extracted for evidence refs;
  the wake-failure risk is recoverable by later results or active
  pulls, not permanent silence.

## 2026-07-22 — C5 opposition strong rule and C7 git layering authorized

- Human Owner explicitly delegated the judgment ("不熟悉,判断不了,你
  判断一下往前走"); the lead AI ruled: adopt both.
- C5: Opposition challenge is now mandatory for every new root goal,
  every substantially new or revised plan, and every material route
  change (previously Chair-discretionary). Opposition still has no
  approval/veto power. Applied to root `AGENTS.md` Goal Lock and
  `backend/AGENTS.md` Goal Lock.
- C7: local git operations (branch, merge, commit, delete local
  branches) are authorized as ordinary work; push, force operations,
  history rewrite, deleting historical evidence, and touching unrelated
  projects still require explicit human authorization. Root `AGENTS.md`
  Safety section updated.
- The permanent frozen section (programs only record) was not touched.
- Basis: NextOS 2.0 knowledge base research packages 1–4 (all completed
  and folded into `Obsidian Vault/Projects/Development/NextOS-2.0/`).

## 2026-07-22 — NextOS 2.0 design enriched and Owner authorized push

- Same day, the design was enriched from three source sets: the Obsidian
  多Agent知识库 (46 files), Bear notes plus Downloads (V3 series, 0703
  role discussion, ai-operating-plane, AI Agent Management), and the
  cobusgreyling/loop-engineering repository. A NextOS 2.0 knowledge base
  was built at `Obsidian Vault/Projects/Development/NextOS-2.0/` with
  55 design viewpoints, a historical-evolution page, and module pages.
- Key enrichments adopted: opposition is plan-side only (never
  post-hoc); reviewer/independent check has no binding veto; independence
  comes from mechanism (framing/sources/path/tools/model), not role
  names; orphan skill packages are folded into existing roles as
  sub-perspectives; evidence has both hardness (L0-L3) and claim scope
  (E0-E3) axes; dual ledger (STATE as Chair judgment vs program Run
  facts); Goal Cell phase relay for context exhaustion (reuses the
  existing goal_cells.py transport); worktree+manifest per line;
  token cost accounting as recorded fact only.
- First live carriers created in the knowledge base: GOAL.md with 8
  verbatim Owner intent entries (gates narrowed: token cost and git
  operations are AI-autonomous; execution/review never asks; plan-stage
  is the Owner's participation point; completion is notify-only) and
  PLAN.md with the first-round draft (build the system's own carriers
  and Chair contract first: L1 carrier line + L2 Chair contract line).
- Contract template (card → task prompt) and Chair five-step prompt
  contract finalized. The open-items list is fully closed; the Owner
  instructed that all previously decided items may now be pushed.
- No program, prompt, role package, or frozen-rule content was changed
  by this work; implementation begins with the Round-1 lines above.

## 2026-07-22 — NextOS 2.0 blueprint authored (design only, not yet adopted)

- Human Owner and lead AI converged a full NextOS 2.0 design across one
  discussion session; the blueprint lives at
  `docs/command-room/nextos-2.0-blueprint.md`. No program, prompt, role
  package, or frozen-rule content was changed.
- Core design decisions: six explicit layer carriers (facts, STATE.md,
  GOAL.md with human-intent layer plus AI-interpreted goal layer, PLAN.md,
  card deck organized by lines, two-level convergence); rounds as the time
  unit, lines as the true-parallelism unit, cards as the action unit; big
  loop (round) and small loop (card) with judgment-only gates; human role
  reduced to intent source, experience judge, and irreversible-action
  authorizer; AI owns goals, judgment, and acceptance with anti-idle-loop
  safeguards (reality anchoring, opposition, independent check, intent
  traceability).
- The blueprint awaits Human Owner confirmation (the first intent-alignment
  gate) before any implementation. Open items recorded in the blueprint:
  orphan role-package disposition and the first 2.0 round's goal slice.

## 2026-07-21 — Stalled-run handling moved into prompts, not program timeouts

- Evidenced failure: one Chair run (89161b83) hung on a stalled stream for the
  full 65-minute no-progress watchdog while showing zero visible output, and
  the UI kept it as "running" the whole time. Human Owner direction: the
  sub-AI is an agent; fix this in the prompt and task assignment, not by
  shortening program timeouts.
- `command-room-executor` (0.1.1) now requires checkpointing partial results
  to the task's named output paths on long work, and returning partial facts
  plus the blocker immediately when stalled instead of running without
  observable output.
- `nextos-commander` (0.7.1) now assigns long or uncertain work as bounded
  checkpoints with named output paths, requires partial results over
  open-ended execution, and directs the Chair to inspect checkpoints and
  re-scope, reassign, or cancel a child that shows no observable progress
  rather than wait indefinitely.
- The 65-minute no-progress watchdog stays as the hard system boundary it is;
  it records the terminal fact and is not a coordination mechanism.

## 2026-07-20 — Command Room direct execution is now the default

- Human feedback after live use: merely granting direct tools did not improve
  command quality while delegation remained the default. The former
  direct-or-delegate wording is superseded for Command Room behavior.
- The Chair now executes ordinary in-scope work itself by default. `task()` is
  reserved for work that genuinely needs independent context, parallelism, a
  separate perspective, or more context than the Chair can hold. Mounted paths
  follow the same rule and are no longer delegated by default.
- Existing human-confirmation boundaries for destructive, irreversible,
  production, public, money, credential, and sensitive-data actions are
  unchanged. Focused prompt, role-package, task-transport, and lint checks
  passed (66 tests); all six SkillOpt packs passed with hard/soft scores of
  1.0. The Gateway was restarted only after a read-only run-state check found
  no active run.

## 2026-07-20 — Command Room direct execution and command authority enabled

- Human Owner authorized the Command Room to execute directly while retaining
  command authority. The former hard-coded `file:read` allowlist and final
  Command Room tool-name filter are removed; it now receives its configured
  tool groups (all configured groups for the built-in profile), MCP tools, and
  existing Command Room coordination tools.
- The Chair chooses direct execution when its context is sufficient and uses
  `task()` for useful independent, parallel, or long-running work. Existing
  human-confirmation requirements for destructive, irreversible, production,
  public, money, credential, or sensitive-data actions remain unchanged.
- Updated the runtime, embedded client, capability snapshot, Chair prompt,
  charter, method, and user documentation. Focused pytest, Command Room/task
  transport tests, and backend lint are recorded with this change.
- Restarted the local Gateway on `127.0.0.1:8001` to load the change. During
  graceful shutdown, the runtime recorded one in-flight run as `interrupted`;
  no external service or sensitive value was exposed by this work.

## 2026-07-20 — Planner role removed; the Chair drafts every plan

- Owner decision: the plan belongs to the Command Room; Opposition is used
  only when the Chair decides an independent challenge is necessary. The
  `planner` role duplicated Chair work and is removed. The earlier
  Planner → Opposition → Chair plan → human discussion contract is superseded
  (history kept below).
- New escalated sequence: Chair drafts the complete plan itself → human
  discussion and natural-language confirmation → plan-directed execution, with
  one Opposition challenge only when the Chair decides one is necessary. The
  Project Manager next-stage handoff keeps the same optional-Opposition rule.
- Removed: `planner` from `COMMAND_ROOM_ROLE_CONFIGS`/`COMMAND_ROOM_ROLE_SKILLS`
  and `_CUSTOM_OVERRIDABLE_BUILTINS`; the `skills/custom/command-room-planner/`
  package; the zh-CN `roleCopy.planner` entry.
- Reworded: Opposition role description and package now challenge the complete
  Chair draft plan; `nextos-commander` bumped to 0.7.0 and
  `command-room-opposition` to 0.2.0; root and backend `AGENTS.md` planning
  contract; README/README_zh substantive-work flow; `config.example.yaml`
  override example; the "What is DeerFlow" opposition bullet now reads
  必要时需要反方; probes (`command-room-ai-native`, `command-room-opposition`,
  `command-room-readonly`) and `skillopt/nextos-commander` rules/tasks.
- Compact Command Room prompt stays under the 10 000-char budget after the
  rewrite.
- Checks: focused pytest set (187 passed), `tests/test_command_room*.py`
  (66 passed, 2 skipped), `make lint`, `pnpm check`, frontend unit tests for
  the agents page/API (planner-free).

## 2026-07-20 — Read-only fast path: decision gate enforcement

- Live evidence (thread `17e8e59f-3c7d-404d-abc8-a7aea37b4c71`) showed the
  earlier prose-only fast path was not followed: one read-only discovery
  question still produced Goal Mandate + Brief + Map, a Planner child, an
  Opposition child, and a confirmation pause before any scanning. Root causes:
  the rule sat mid-block under heavier ceremony text, `record_goal_workspace`
  and `task` descriptions carried no negative guidance at the decision point,
  and recorded Mandates re-injected each turn reinforced the ceremony.
- The compact Command Room prompt now opens `<command_room>` with a
  **FIRST — classify every request before any tool call** gate: read-only
  discovery answers directly via `ls`/`read_file`/`glob`/`grep` in the same
  run; ordinary safe work executes directly; only the five escalation
  conditions use Planner → Opposition → Chair plan → human discussion. A
  concrete direct-handling example (the actual pinduoduo-discovery question)
  follows the gate. Duplicate read-only/ordinary-work/Planner-condition
  bullets lower in the block were merged into the gate to keep the prompt
  under the 10 000-char compact budget.
- `record_goal_workspace` and `task` docstrings now state at the decision
  point: not for read-only discovery the Chair can inspect itself.
- Memory bias fix (same incident): the command-room memory had grown to 100
  facts / 42 KB of audit and inventory narration, so every run injected
  ceremony-shaped context. It was slimmed to 11 facts / 11 KB (backup at
  `memory.json.bak-20260720`), keeping user preferences, explicit corrections,
  and current goals. `MEMORY_UPDATE_PROMPT` gained a compression-discipline
  rule: closed tasks collapse to one outcome fact, superseded statuses go to
  `factsToRemove`, preferences beat process narration. Note the gateway had
  already rewritten the file once while running; the updater prompt change
  needs a gateway restart to take effect.
- New probe `scripts/command-room-readonly-probe.py` (+`.sh`): asks one
  read-only question and captures the factual tool trace
  (`record_goal_workspace_calls`, `task_calls`, `read_tool_calls`) so an
  independent review AI can verify the direct-answer fast path; pinned by
  `tests/test_command_room_probes.py` capture and prompt-shape tests.
- Checks: 160 focused prompt, Command Room, role-package, tool, and
  task-transport tests passed (2 skipped); 357 memory tests passed; probe and
  prompt suites green; `make lint` and `make format` passed. No live system
  accessed; no secrets exposed.

## 2026-07-20 — Command Room read-only fast path

- The Human Owner reported that simple project discovery was unnecessarily
  entering Planner, Opposition, and confirmation pauses. The live Chair prompt
  and `nextos-commander` method now define read-only discovery—locating a
  project, reading its instructions/status, or inspecting files, code, and
  logs—as immediate Chair work: no Goal Mandate, Brief, Organization Map,
  Planner/Opposition task, or confirmation pause.
- Ordinary safe, bounded execution remains directly authorized. A concise
  Chair plan is now only made or communicated when several consequential
  execution steps require it; the existing escalation and irreversible-action
  boundaries are unchanged.
- Focused prompt, role-package, task-transport, background-wakeup, and client
  checks: `204 passed`; Ruff check and formatting check passed. No live system
  or external service was accessed, and no secrets were exposed. The six-pack
  SkillOpt probe passed with every train/validation/test hard and soft score at
  `1.0`.

## 2026-07-19 — Command Room fast-lane governance

- The Human Owner approved a faster default for ordinary safe, bounded work:
  direct human requests authorize concise Chair planning and execution without
  Planner, Opposition, or a confirmation pause.
- Planner → Opposition → Chair → human discussion now applies only to a changed
  Goal Mandate, material architecture or operating-workflow decision, unresolved
  material trade-off, external or irreversible consequence, or an explicit
  request for review. Phase results continue directly unless they introduce the
  same condition.
- Brief records now occur at workstream start or a material change to next work;
  task receipts, acknowledgements, and history reads do not each create a Brief.
  Organization Maps are only needed for changing workstreams or dependencies.
- A clearly transient provider or transport failure before work begins may be
  re-dispatched once under a new task id; cancelled, interrupted, ambiguous, and
  potentially side-effecting work still returns to the human. The permanent
  fact-only program boundary, safety stops, Chair read-only boundary, and
  content-blind resource limits remain unchanged.
- Focused Chair prompt, role-package, tool-exposure, and task-transport tests:
  83 passed. Ruff, JSON parsing, `git diff --check`, and all six SkillOpt packs
  passed with hard and soft scores of 1.0.

## 2026-07-19 — V3 handoff and instruction/Skill evaluation closure

- Saved the complete V3 organization foundation, tests, role packages,
  planning records, and handoff as local commit `3f912d46`. The canonical next
  entry is `.planning/v3-organization/v3-handoff-2026-07-19.md`; it directs the
  next window to a bounded real-project pilot rather than an unproven third
  implementation slice.
- Compressed only duplicated method wording in repository `AGENTS.md`, from
  12,848 to 11,333 bytes. The backend instruction chain is now approximately
  32,130 bytes and the frontend chain 31,639 bytes, both below the 32 KiB
  budget. The permanent frozen program-recording section and all Chair/program
  authority boundaries are unchanged.
- Extended `scripts/skillopt-probe.sh` with one shared positive/negative probe
  set for runtime reliability, persistence/migration, frontend protocol,
  security, and platform operations auditor Skills. Every auditor now checks a
  bounded domain method, factual return, evidence class, no-overclaim boundary,
  no-fix boundary, and no authority to approve or complete work. The existing
  Skill bodies were not expanded.
- Commander plus all five auditor packs scored hard/soft 1.0 on train,
  validation, and test splits. All six Skill folders passed the Skill Creator
  validator; focused role/prompt tests passed 40 tests; `git diff --check`
  passed. No runtime, API, persistence, frontend, production, external service,
  credential, customer, or payment behavior changed.

## 2026-07-19 — Codex child-process performance boundary confirmed

- A controlled one-shot Codex A/B probe confirmed that the remaining resource
  cost is not a DeerFlow process leak. With the current complete user Codex
  configuration, one idle-tool task peaked at 18 processes and 1,124.5 MiB
  aggregate RSS. `--ignore-user-config` reduced that to 2 processes and
  171.9 MiB, but removed the user's configured MCP/plugin capability surface.
- The installed and current npm release is Codex CLI 0.144.6. It still eagerly
  starts every enabled MCP server for each session; there is no supported lazy
  startup or shared-server switch. DeerFlow already terminates the complete
  child process group on success, failure, timeout, and cancellation, and the
  probe left no DeerFlow child process behind.
- Human Owner explicitly chose to retain all MCP, plugin, Skill, and agent
  capabilities. Therefore no `--ignore-user-config`, MCP filter, tool profile,
  reduced task concurrency, shared AI process, or programmatic tool gate was
  added. The measured memory is an accepted capacity cost until Codex provides
  lossless lazy/shared MCP lifecycle support, not a reason for program control
  over AI capabilities.
- Gateway `:8001` and Nginx `:2026` remain healthy and running for clean-window
  testing. The benchmark invoked only a no-tool Codex response; it made no
  production or business-system mutation and exposed no credential or customer
  data.

## 2026-07-19 — One-plan flow and professional audit roles restored

- A real restart exposed one remaining program-lifecycle defect: every pending
  Chair wake was retried after restart, even when its previous Run was
  `interrupted`, and a gracefully cancelled child was recovered into another
  automatic Chair Run. That revived the stopped audit twice and created two
  unwanted tasks before the Gateway was stopped.
- Corrected only the objective transport boundary. A cancelled child is now
  recorded with terminal wake fact `child_cancelled` without starting Chair;
  an interrupted or cancelled Chair wake is recorded as stopped and is not
  retried. Other genuine delivery failures retain the existing bounded retry.
  No prompt content is parsed, no result is accepted, and no AI workflow or
  quality gate was added.
- Focused background recovery, wake admission, Chair prompt, and stop-boundary
  regression: **43 passed**; full backend `make lint` passed. Live restart then
  settled the cancelled task without creating a new Run or an eleventh task;
  Gateway, frontend, and Nginx are healthy at `http://localhost:2026`.
- The Human Owner stopped the low-value real-project audit. Three independent
  audit children completed and preserved their reports; the overloaded backend
  child ran for about 51 minutes and ended without a final message, after which
  the old Chair attempted one retry. That retry and the local Gateway were
  stopped so the stale Thread could not continue waking or spending resources.
- The observed first step—one Planner—was correct. The immediately preceding
  “six-way planning wave” entry overcorrected a task-count concern and is now
  explicitly superseded. The AI-owned organization flow is one Planner → one
  Opposition → Chair execution plan → human discussion and explicit
  natural-language confirmation → plan-directed parallel execution. After a
  phase report changes the route, it is Project Manager → Opposition → Chair
  next-stage plan → another human discussion pause. Programs do not enforce
  either sequence. This planning sequence applies only to a new substantive
  execution plan or material revision; confirmed-plan execution, ordinary
  fixes, stopping low-value work, and bounded optimizations continue directly.
- Six outstanding children remain resource capacity, never a quota. The Chair
  chooses the useful plan-derived count and should split independently
  separable professional domains instead of overloading one child. Every child
  handoff now requires exact working, input, and output paths.
- Added fixed, reusable role charters and method Skills for runtime reliability,
  persistence and migrations, frontend protocol, security, and platform
  operations. These labels inject professional prompt context only; they do not
  grant tools, route work, score results, or approve completion. In particular,
  the previously overloaded backend audit can now be split into runtime and
  persistence work without inventing tasks merely to fill six slots.
- Aligned repository/backend/frontend instructions, the Chair prompt and Skill,
  English and Chinese user documentation, role API expectations, and the
  NextOS SkillOpt scenarios. The focused prompt/role/task/background regression
  selection passed **195** tests with one upstream TestClient deprecation
  warning; the later confirmed-plan boundary correction passed **43** focused
  tests. The full backend `make lint` and targeted MDX Prettier checks passed;
  SkillOpt hard/soft was **1.0** on train, validation, and test splits; `git
  diff --check` passed.
- No scheduler, queue, retry, persistence, API, Goal Cell, History, or frontend
  runtime behavior changed in this correction. No production or external
  business system was accessed, and no credential or customer data was exposed.
  The normal local Gateway remains intentionally stopped pending a clean new
  pilot conversation or an explicit decision about the stale Thread.

## 2026-07-19 — Superseded: broad planning restored to a six-way parallel wave

- Superseded by the correction above. Kept only as development history; do not
  use this entry as the current organization contract.

- The first real-project conversation dispatched only one Planner because the
  Chair prompt required that single proposal to return before Opposition or
  execution. Human Owner clarified that the established planning flow remains,
  but broad planning and information collection must not be serialized behind
  one Planner.
- The AI-owned flow is now parallel planning and fact finding → Opposition →
  Chair plan → parallel execution → completion. Broad work may use all six
  Command Room slots in its planning wave; the Gateway still supplies only the
  existing content-blind 6/12/64 resource capacity and makes no AI decision.
- Removed the singular Planner bottleneck from the Chair prompt and aligned the
  repository/backend contract, Commander Skill, user documentation, focused
  tests, and SkillOpt wording. No background scheduler, persistence, API,
  Goal Cell, History, or Project Manager runtime code changed.
- Focused prompt/role/task/background tests: 55 passed. Ruff, targeted MDX
  Prettier, and the NextOS SkillOpt probe passed; SkillOpt hard/soft remained
  1.0 on train, validation, and test cases. The already-running old Gateway was
  not restarted while its child process remained active.

## 2026-07-19 — V3 基础能力最终收口与本地 Gateway 核查

- 按授权仅运行 Ruff 对 `backend/app/gateway/command_room_background.py` 的格式化；文件已符合格式，未产生逻辑或文本变化。
- 全仓 `backend make lint` 全绿：Ruff check 通过，744 个文件格式检查通过。
- 隔离本地 replay Gateway 的真实 HTTP 健康检查、专用 thread 创建和 owner-scoped History 路由可达性通过；正常本地 Gateway 无授权会话返回预期 401，因此未伪造会话或扩大权限，带 owner 的多版本/结果/ack/Chair 全链路证据留待 Human Owner 提供本地测试会话后再做。
- 前端单元 829 passed；Work Record Playwright 6 passed。未访问生产或外部业务系统，未修改业务逻辑。
- 未发现需要第三切片处理的 P0。按 Human Owner 授权停止在第三切片确认点，建议转入真实项目使用。

## 2026-07-19 — NextOS V3 second slice: Workspace factual history and context recovery

- The Human Owner confirmed the bounded second slice: Workspace factual history
  and context recovery with only minimal Prompt, Skill, and read-only cockpit
  projections. P1/Later items and every explicitly excluded workflow,
  organization-graph, RAG, persistent-queue, approval, scoring, automatic-role,
  and automatic-project-manager idea remain unimplemented.
- Reused the existing append-only `workspace_events` store without a table,
  migration, or event type. SQL and memory stores now expose an exact-owner,
  newest-first, 1–100-item history page with an exclusive revision cursor and
  unchanged body, metadata, hash, author Run, and timestamp values.
- Added the Chair-only `read_goal_workspace_history` tool and owner-scoped
  `GET /api/threads/{thread_id}/goal-workspace/history`. The existing current
  context remains latest Mandate/Brief/Map plus the pending Inbox; the new route
  contains all factual event types, including previously acknowledged complete
  results and notification/acknowledgement delivery facts. Reading changes
  nothing, and acknowledgement remains neither acceptance, completion, deletion,
  nor hiding.
- Added a lazy Work Record History section. It loads no history until expanded,
  then reads bounded pages of raw facts and can load older pages. It adds no
  approval, acceptance, acknowledgement, dispatch, priority, retry, phase, or
  completion control. Chair/Project Manager handoff text now states that history
  is selected by the Chair, Brief is a current AI-owned index, and Goal Cells/
  PMs receive only Chair-selected facts.
- Validation: relevant backend Workspace/API/background/Goal Cell/prompt/role
  regression selection passed **235** tests (one upstream TestClient deprecation
  warning); frontend unit suite passed **829** tests; `pnpm check` and targeted
  Prettier passed; the six Work Record Playwright scenarios passed; `git diff
  --check` passed; and the NextOS SkillOpt static probe scored hard/soft **1.0**
  on train, validation, and both test cases.
- Targeted Ruff checks and formatting for this slice passed. The repository-wide
  backend `make lint` format check remains blocked only by the pre-existing,
  untouched formatting difference in `backend/app/gateway/command_room_background.py`;
  no queue behavior was changed here.
- No production or external business system was accessed or mutated. No
  credential, customer, or payment data was exposed. Stop at the third-slice
  confirmation point; do not extend this implementation without a new Human
  Owner decision.

## 2026-07-19 — NextOS V3 Goal-Mandate autonomous organization foundation

- The Human Owner confirmed the V3 product principle: people contribute
  interest, direction, possibility, real-world permission, and material
  boundaries; AI owns professional planning, opposition, organization,
  execution, comparison, correction, and completion inside that Goal Mandate.
  This entry supersedes earlier same-day requirements for per-plan human
  confirmation; those entries remain only as development history.
- Added an append-only, owner-scoped Goal Workspace event store and migration.
  Command Room can persist the complete opaque Goal Mandate and Current
  Operating Brief, and every later Run receives the current records without a
  program parsing or interpreting their prose.
- Added a durable Result Inbox. Every complete child return is persisted as a
  separate unchanged envelope; reads never acknowledge or delete it, explicit
  Chair acknowledgement is monotonic but is not acceptance, and concurrent
  completions may coalesce only their wake signal. Recovery preserves the
  result high-water mark and can finish notification after an already
  successful wake without replaying child work.
- Added recursive Goal Cells by reusing owner-scoped `command-room` Threads.
  Each Cell inherits the complete Goal Mandate, receives a local opaque Brief,
  can create narrower Cells through the same Chair loop, and explicitly returns
  its complete result and artifact references to the parent Result Inbox.
  Public metadata cannot forge the parent/root linkage.
- Added the factual Activity-panel view for Goal Workspace, complete Result
  Inbox envelopes, and the recursive Goal Tree in English and Chinese. The UI
  contains no approval, acceptance, acknowledgement, retry, or completion
  control for these records; runtime status is labelled only as a runtime fact.
  The user-facing Lead Agent and Subagent documentation now describes
  Goal-Mandate autonomy rather than plan-by-plan authorization.
- Capability and workspace references currently remain structural facts and do
  not grant permissions. Each Cell has an isolated Thread workspace. The next
  product decision is the default parent/child material boundary: sealed input
  snapshot, read-only parent view plus isolated writes, or shared writable
  state. No sharing or capability expansion was silently selected.
- The Human Owner selected the default material boundary: a Chair names exact
  parent files; the Gateway copies their bytes into the child Cell's sealed
  read-only input capsule, while the Cell keeps its own writable workspace and
  outputs. The parent file list, child capsule paths, SHA-256 values, and byte
  counts are objective transport facts. The program neither selects materials,
  interprets their content, assesses relevance or quality, grants AI
  capabilities, accepts a result, gates an AI-AI handoff, or decides whether
  work is complete.
- Goal Cell `task` execution now always uses `workspace-write`, even on a local
  development profile that otherwise permits unrestricted host access. The
  child Chair's direct read-only tools are likewise kept to the child's virtual
  thread paths, so they can read the sealed capsule but not fall through to a
  direct host path. This is an access-isolation boundary only: it prevents a
  child from modifying the parent capsule or unrelated host state; it does not
  impose a role, workflow, approval, score, result check, or any other program
  judgment. A server-owned durable Cell marker supplies the capsule path only
  when a snapshot exists.
- Validation for the sealed-capsule increment: 245 focused backend tests passed,
  including exact-byte snapshot immutability, idempotent recovery after a parent
  source changes, read-only file mode, context injection, and forced child sandbox scope; Ruff
  lint/format passed. The NextOS SkillOpt static probe remained hard 1.0 on its
  train, validation, and two test cases.
- Validation: backend full suite 6089 passed and 19 optional tests skipped;
  focused persistence, recovery, recursion, prompt, role, wake, router, and
  migration suite 221 passed; Ruff lint and format checks passed. Frontend unit
  suite 827 passed, `pnpm check` and targeted Prettier passed, and the changed
  desktop/mobile Activity workflow passed 6 Playwright scenarios with an
  inspected browser screenshot. The NextOS Skill validator passed; the new
  SkillOpt static probe scored hard 1.0 on train, validation, and two test
  cases.
- Restarted the local development stack. Gateway startup applied migration
  `0013_factual_round_records -> 0014_goal_workspace_events`; Gateway, frontend,
  and Nginx returned HTTP 200, while an unauthenticated Goal Workspace request
  returned the expected HTTP 401. Docker Desktop already owned port 3000, so
  the project launcher correctly selected frontend port 6001 behind Nginx
  `:2026`.
- A first embedded-client AI-behaviour probe exposed that the Planner and
  Opposition override resolved to the Codex CLI model id `gpt-5.6-sol`, which
  this local CLI account could not start. Both roles now use the already proven
  local `gpt-5.6-terra` transport at maximum reasoning. The rerun completed the
  intended Planner -> Opposition -> Chair synthesis -> Fact Finder -> Chair
  result sequence without plan-by-plan human confirmation. The embedded client
  intentionally bypasses Gateway persistence, so it was not used as Result
  Inbox evidence.
- A separate authenticated local Gateway smoke thread
  `v3-gateway-smoke-1784448869` then proved the actual V3 transport. The first
  Chair Run durably wrote one Goal Mandate and one Operating Brief, dispatched
  one background Fact Finder, and ended. The child result was independently
  appended unchanged; the automatic wake created one second successful Chair
  Run, which explicitly acknowledged the result and wrote a revised Brief. The
  notification fact was recorded only after that wake succeeded. SQLite shows
  the six append-only facts in order: mandate, brief, result received,
  acknowledgement, revised brief, notification. No result body was merged or
  interpreted by the program.
- The post-fix prompt/role selection passed 42 focused tests, Ruff passed, the
  NextOS Skill validator passed, and the SkillOpt static probe remained hard
  1.0 across train, validation, and two test cases. The one-off Gateway polling
  wrapper was interrupted after the durable success facts appeared because its
  exit predicate still required an unacknowledged result after the Chair had
  already acknowledged it; that wrapper condition did not affect either Run or
  the persisted events.
- The permanently frozen program-is-fact-only subsection was not changed. No
  production or live business system was accessed or mutated, and no
  credential, customer, or payment data was exposed.

## 2026-07-19 — NextOS V3 organization map, project manager, and factual capacity

- Added `organization.map.revised` as an owner-scoped append-only Goal
  Workspace fact. A Chair can record its complete temporary organization map;
  the latest opaque body is returned in later Chair context, `/goal-workspace`,
  and the existing read-only Work Record panel. The implementation reuses the
  generic Workspace events table, so it adds no schema or migration.
- Added the fixed `project-manager` professional role and its role package. It
  receives a Chair-provided Goal Mandate, Brief, Organization Map, and complete
  stage facts, then returns a proposed next stage, dependencies, temporary
  organization, risks, and handoff. It cannot dispatch work, alter Workspace
  facts, approve results, close a goal, or advance a program state. Its two
  role files are explicitly versionable alongside the other built-in NextOS
  role packages.
- Replaced the unbounded Command Room background child launch with one
  process-local FIFO resource pool: 12 child `execute` slots across the
  Gateway, 64 waiting slots, and at most 6 admitted queued-or-running children
  for one `(user, Command Room thread)`. Admission consults only identity and
  fixed numeric capacity; it never reads prompt or result content, chooses a
  role, ranks priority, judges quality, recognizes a phase, or decides a next
  AI action. A finished child releases its execution slot before its Chair wake
  runs, so waiting work is not held behind conversational wake handling.
- TaskLane now exposes raw `queued`, `running`, and `finished` execution facts
  using the existing factual handoff envelope. The pool is deliberately local
  to the single-Gateway topology: a restart still never invents a replacement
  Python callable or claims durable distributed queuing.
- Focused verification passed: 209 backend tests (one dependency deprecation
  warning), Ruff, 8 frontend unit tests, `pnpm check`, 6 Work Record Playwright
  scenarios, `git diff --check`, and the NextOS SkillOpt static probe with hard
  1.0 on train, validation, and test cases. No production or live business
  system was accessed or mutated, and no secret, customer, or payment data was
  exposed.

## 2026-07-19 — Frontend recovery, performance, stale checks, and AI-AI-AI governance

- Fixed the real chat recovery failures found in the repository-wide run:
  recovery errors now replace the loading skeleton instead of leaving a blank
  page; a missing history no longer erases its own recovery notice; successful
  bounded snapshots do not immediately repeat the same run-list request; and
  historical subtask wake facts load only when the card is opened.
- Fixed current-round history replacement. When run timestamps tie, the native
  runtime-round order now wins over a stale `/runs` response, so starting a new
  round or resuming its current run removes prior-round history and renders the
  new result. The failing browser scenario passed five consecutive repeats and
  the complete 102-scenario browser run.
- Repaired stale browser fixtures and expectations: the mock roles API, delete
  confirmation, NextOS display name, genuinely old bounded-snapshot timestamps,
  and on-demand wake-fact expansion. Removed the obsolete `@types/gsap` stub.
  Optional local-PostgreSQL integration checks now skip when their explicit
  loopback URL is absent, while unsafe URL validation remains active.
- Moved request-path disk, hashing, encryption, upload, channel attachment,
  MCP/Skill config, prompt-package, and file-conversion work off the backend
  event loop. The static blocking-I/O inventory fell from 73 findings (5 high)
  to zero. Concurrent role-model updates now use an atomic per-user operation;
  malformed role assignment JSON falls back to defaults instead of returning
  HTTP 500. A latent async `grep` option-forwarding defect was also fixed.
- Strengthened AI-AI-AI governance without adding an orchestrator program:
  Command Room keeps read-only factual inspection, the distinct
  Planner → Opposition → Chair → human-confirmed execution contract, and
  optional temporary independent checking. Removed the stale fixed-Verifier
  test/config residue and duplicate built-in role prompt definitions. The root
  rules now state explicitly that child results are facts for continuing the
  plan, there is no task-level acceptance, and completion means the plan's
  actual criteria are satisfied. The permanently frozen program-is-fact-only
  subsection was not changed.
- Evidence: backend full run 6073 passed and 22 optional integrations skipped;
  changed backend selection 938 passed and 2 optional integrations skipped;
  frontend lint/type checks passed; frontend unit run 823 passed; browser run 102
  passed; blocking-I/O inventory returned zero; Ruff and targeted Prettier
  completed without errors.
- Restarted Gateway `:8001`, frontend `:3000`, and Nginx `:2026`. Health,
  direct frontend, and Nginx returned HTTP 200; unauthenticated `/api/roles`
  returned the expected 401 instead of 500, and startup logs contained no error
  signal.
- No production or live business system was accessed or mutated. No credential,
  customer, or payment data was exposed.

## 2026-07-19 — AI Team model configuration in the management UI

- Upgraded the existing Agents workspace into an `AI Team` page with separate
  `Agents` and `Professional Roles` tabs. Command Room is now the first
  built-in agent, can be configured but cannot be created twice or deleted.
- Added one shared model/reasoning dialog. Agent settings are saved in that
  user's agent `config.yaml`; Planner, Executor, Fact Finder, Opposition, and
  Recorder assignments are saved in the user's atomic
  `role-assignments.json`. No provider credential, role enablement, stage,
  acceptance, or program workflow controls were added.
- Agent reasoning settings are read when the next conversation builds its lead
  AI. Professional-role assignments are read when the next `task()` is
  dispatched and override the static `subagents` defaults. Neither path needs a
  service restart after a setting changes, and neither path lets the program
  choose a role, model, sequence, or result judgment.
- Kept model names provider-neutral in storage. The UI lists the models already
  registered by DeerFlow; future Kimi, GLM, or Opus assignments can reuse this
  configuration surface after their actual provider/task runner is connected.
- Backend agent/role/task/client regression selection: 259 passed. Frontend
  agent API/page tests: 14 passed. Ruff passed; `pnpm check` passed with zero
  errors and one pre-existing unused-argument warning in
  `frontend/src/core/threads/hooks.ts`.
- Restarted Gateway `:8001`, frontend `:3000`, and Nginx `:2026`. Gateway health
  returned HTTP 200; the authenticated existing UI session loaded its current
  Command Room page and agent API without a startup or request error. No
  browser-control instance was available for an automated visual click-through.
- No production or live business system was accessed or mutated. No credential,
  customer, or payment data was exposed.

## 2026-07-19 — Role-level model and reasoning allocation

- The Human Owner confirmed the current high-reasoning allocation: NextOS
  Command Room, Planner, and Opposition use the configured `gpt-5.6` alias
  (`gpt-5.6-sol`) with `max`; Executor, Fact Finder, and Recorder retain the
  delegated default `gpt-5.6-terra` with `xhigh`.
- Added optional task-label `reasoning_effort` beside the existing model
  override. Task transport only applies the selected configuration; it does not
  inspect task prose, choose a role, choose a model, or judge AI work.
- Model names remain configuration values rather than role implementation.
  Future Kimi, GLM, or Opus use is not prebuilt here; provider/CLI adaptation
  will be added only when one of those models is actually connected.
- The built-in Command Room profile now defaults to `gpt-5.6`; that model's
  configured default reasoning effort is `max`. A user-owned Command Room
  profile can still replace the built-in model setting.
- Focused configuration, task transport, Command Room model resolution,
  background wake, role package, provider, and config-version checks passed:
  195 tests. Ruff passed. An additional mixed regression selection exposed
  three already-present expectation failures in the independently modified
  Chair prompt/capability snapshot tests; none executes the changed role-level
  model path.
- Restarted Gateway `:8001`, frontend `:3000`, and Nginx `:2026`; all returned
  HTTP 200 and current startup logs contained no matching error signal.
- No production or live business system was accessed or mutated. No credential,
  customer, or payment data was exposed.

## 2026-07-19 — AI-owned governance learning and organizational memory

- The Human Owner confirmed the NextOS governance model: project and role
  `AGENTS.md` files hold purpose, authority, and boundaries; Chair and role
  Skills hold narrow reusable coordination and professional methods; task
  prompts hold current context; `Progress.md` holds factual organizational
  memory and never becomes authority or workflow state.
- Added the Chair-owned failure-to-governance method. The Chair corrects the
  current handoff first, then routes an evidenced recurring failure or serious
  redline failure to the lowest effective layer. It may drive narrow role-Skill
  improvements inside the confirmed model; purpose, permanent boundaries,
  authority, planning-contract, and material workflow changes still require the
  human.
- Added proportionate independent checking for materially risky, conflicting,
  unsupported, or hard-to-check results. It is a temporary AI perspective that
  reports discrepancies and uncertainty, not a fixed Reviewer, task acceptance,
  or program gate.
- Programs do not count failures, identify patterns, choose governance layers,
  edit rules, or decide whether a change helped. The runtime still transports
  complete prompts/results, records facts, and wakes the Chair only.
- Normalized the six active role Skills to minimal `name`/`description`
  frontmatter with owner/version/review information in the body. All six passed
  the standard Skill validator. Focused prompt, role-package, task-transport,
  and model-resolution tests passed: 54. Ruff and `git diff --check` passed.
- Updated `.gitignore` so only each configured NextOS role package's
  `AGENTS.md` and `SKILL.md` are versionable; unrelated custom-Skill contents
  remain local. The role governance can therefore survive a clone or handoff.
- Kept instruction loading below the 32 KiB budget by moving backend and
  frontend implementation detail into module references. The measured chains
  are 32,106 bytes for backend and 32,098 bytes for frontend.
- NextOS contract and SkillOpt checks passed. Gateway `:8001`, frontend `:3000`,
  and Nginx `:2026` were restarted and returned HTTP 200; recent startup logs
  contained no error, exception, traceback, or port-conflict signal.
- This entry supersedes older same-day Progress descriptions of a fixed
  Verifier or task-level acceptance loop. Those entries remain only as factual
  development history.
- No production or live business system was accessed or mutated. No credential,
  customer, or payment data was exposed.

## 2026-07-19 — Role packages and AI-owned result comparison

- Added a role `AGENTS.md` charter and a compact, failure-oriented `SKILL.md`
  for the Chair and every configured reusable Command Room worker role:
  planner, executor, fact-finder, opposition, and recorder.
- Task transport now carries the package for the role the Chair already chose;
  it does not select a role, create a stage, or judge a result. The Chair now
  explicitly compares returned claims and artifacts with the original task
  contract, definition of done, current facts, and the confirmed plan.
- Added the WorkOS-derived Skill writing rule to the repository `AGENTS.md`:
  narrow failure-driven methods, explicit boundaries and factual returns,
  owner/version/review, and focused positive/negative evaluation before a Skill
  remains active. The WorkOS state-machine and PASS-gate mechanisms were not
  imported because DeerFlow's locked program boundary remains AI-owned.
- Focused role-package, task-prompt, Chair-prompt, and tool-exposure tests:
  53 passed. A live configuration probe confirmed the executor package reaches
  the delegated task prompt.

## 2026-07-19 — Plan-confirmed execution, no task acceptance

- Chair now has direct read-only file investigation (`ls`, `read_file`, `glob`,
  and `grep`) so it can inspect code, logs, plans, and artifacts before making
  a command decision. Writes, shell work, and execution remain delegated.
- Replaced the former Planner/Opposition/Verifier spine with a distinct plan
  conversation: Planner proposal → Opposition challenge → Chair execution plan
  → human discussion and explicit execution authorization → plan-directed
  execution → plan completion.
- Removed the built-in `verifier` role and task-level acceptance semantics.
  Child results are working facts; the Chair continues the authorized plan and
  returns to the human only for a core direction, scope, authority, or business
  decision change.

## 2026-07-19 — NextOS AI enterprise identity restored

- Restored NextOS as the user-facing AI-organization product layer on the
  DeerFlow runtime. Internal `deerflow.*` packages and the `command-room` agent
  identifier remain unchanged for API, thread, persistence, and import
  compatibility.
- Rebuilt `nextos-commander` around the accepted enterprise-team model: one
  continuing root Chair, persistent goals/decisions/results, temporary
  professional AI instances, Chair-routed natural-language handoffs, and an
  optional temporary bounded workstream lead only when coordination context
  genuinely needs separation.
- Kept the fixed AI-owned quality spine: Planner proposal → Opposition challenge
  → Chair synthesis → execution → Verifier → Chair decision. Parallel route
  exploration uses additional Planners; changed core direction repeats
  Opposition, and changed execution repeats verification.
- The built-in Command Room profile now describes itself as NextOS, exposes the
  restored Commander Skill, and the frontend displays the stable
  `command-room` route as NextOS.
- Did not restore the superseded SkillOpt adjudicator, deterministic lifecycle,
  fixed Steward/Curator chain, program stage gates, or old parallel
  forward/opposition contract. Programs remain fact-only transport, persistence,
  process-lifecycle, and Chair-wakeup infrastructure.
- Runtime loading probe confirmed that the built-in `command-room` profile has
  the NextOS description, enables `nextos-commander`, loads the Skill from disk,
  and receives the NextOS Command Room system prompt.
- Focused backend prompt, role, Skill, task-transport, wake, provider, security,
  client, and probe regression tests: 412 passed. Frontend unit tests: 818
  passed. Ruff, Python formatting, targeted frontend/MDX Prettier, and
  `git diff --check` passed; `pnpm check` completed with zero errors and one
  pre-existing unused-argument warning in `frontend/src/core/threads/hooks.ts`.
- Restarted Gateway, frontend, and Nginx. Gateway `/health`, direct frontend,
  and the Nginx entrypoint all returned HTTP 200; startup logs contained no
  error, exception, traceback, or port-conflict signal, and the services settled
  idle.
- No production or live business system was accessed or mutated, and no secret
  or customer data was exposed.

## 2026-07-19 — Command Room orchestration restrictions removed

- Removed the performance workaround that forced Command Room lead reasoning
  from `high`/`xhigh`/`max` down to `medium`.
- Removed `SubagentLimitMiddleware` and the six-call request boundary. The lead
  AI now chooses the useful `task()` count; legacy `max_concurrent_subagents`
  inputs are ignored instead of controlling prompts, cache keys, or execution.
- Added the built-in `verifier` role and standardized the Chinese name as
  “独立核验 AI”; no `Reviewer` role or alias remains. Substantive Command Room
  work now follows an AI-owned planner proposal → one opposition challenge →
  Chair synthesis → execution → independent verification → Chair decision
  contract. Opposition runs after the complete proposal, repeats only when
  synthesis changes the core direction, and never becomes program state.
- Parallel independent proposals remain available as additional planning
  perspectives; they are not labeled opposition. Opposition reports hidden
  assumptions, counterevidence, failure modes, and materially different
  alternatives without forced disagreement or authority over the decision.
- Verification checks the completed result and actual artifacts and reports
  discrepancies and unresolved facts. It does not approve, reject, modify the
  work, or replace Chair judgment; no program state or parsed verdict enforces
  this collaboration flow.
- Preserved each complete child prompt during provider replay. Background task
  receipts and terminal wake messages now carry facts without directing the
  Chair to end, continue, compare, or ask for specific human input.
- Updated the repository/backend contracts, English and Chinese documentation,
  middleware diagrams, and the literature-review Skill. Hard child timeout,
  cancellation, process cleanup, authentication, credential isolation, and
  owner scoping remain unchanged.
- Restart exposed a pre-existing migration incompatibility: 64 valid historical
  wake Runs predated `command_room_wake_id`. Migration `0011` now preserves
  those rows with a null dedicated identity while still rejecting malformed or
  duplicate non-null IDs. The local database reached revision `0012` without
  deleting or rewriting historical records.
- Focused backend integration: 395 passed; migration/persistence: 39 passed.
  Backend excluding the external-PostgreSQL-only contract file: 6045 passed, 20
  skipped. The unfiltered run had 6052 passed and only two failures because
  `DEER_FLOW_TEST_RUN_LEASE_POSTGRES_URL` is not set. Frontend: 817 passed;
  `pnpm check` completed with one pre-existing unused-argument warning.
- The sequential Planner/Opposition/Chair contract passed 317 focused prompt,
  role, probe, task-transport, wake, provider, security, and client tests. The
  Command Room suite excluding its external-PostgreSQL-only file passed 51;
  the unfiltered selection passed 57 and had only the same two missing-environment
  failures. Ruff, Python formatting, MDX Prettier, and `git diff --check` passed;
  `pnpm check` again had zero errors and the same pre-existing warning.
- A Nextra/Turbopack cold documentation compile exposed a stale 7.0 GB ignored
  `frontend/.next` cache and sustained multi-core compilation. The stopped
  cache was moved recoverably to the user's Trash, rebuilt to about 905 MB,
  and the frontend settled near idle before final health checks.
- Restarted Gateway, frontend, and Nginx. Gateway `/health`, direct frontend,
  and the Nginx entrypoint all returned healthy/HTTP 200 with no startup errors.
- No production/live business system was accessed or mutated, and no secret or
  customer data was exposed.

## 2026-07-17 — AI-AI-AI fact-only program boundary

- Human Owner explicitly authorized this repository-wide reset and the protected
  amendment under `AGENTS.md > What is DeerFlow`.
- DeerFlow now permanently defines deterministic code as a factual recorder and
  transport mechanism only. AI natural-language work can be assessed and
  directed only by AI; code cannot make those decisions or turn recorded facts
  into authority over AI work.
- Removed the superseded deterministic work-control assets, specialized Skills,
  state transitions, automatic follow-up chains, compatibility fields, UI
  projections, tests, probes, plans, evidence documents, and historical
  descriptions that encoded that behavior.
- `task()` carries one complete natural-language prompt to one short-lived AI
  process and returns its complete natural-language result. Command Room
  background completion still wakes the lead AI with facts.
- Preserved transport recovery, hard timeout and cancellation, authentication,
  credential isolation, process cleanup, owner scoping, redaction, and
  non-mutating factual timelines. These mechanisms do not evaluate AI output or
  decide the next AI action.
- No live service or production system was accessed or mutated. No credential
  or customer data was exposed.

## 2026-07-22 — NextOS 2.0 Round 003-A 入口预算对齐与 L1 窄回归

- 在 Gateway 共享 `build_run_config()` 只为规范化后的 `command-room` 未显式
  `recursion_limit` 请求恢复既有默认 1000；显式配置仍优先，普通 Agent 默认
  仍为 100。后台 wake 复用同一入口，没有在 wake 调用点单独补丁。
- 聚焦 Gateway/background-wake/admission 套件共 120 通过；作用域 Ruff 与
  格式检查、`git diff --check` 通过。全量 `make lint` 仍被三个既有的
  `backend/packages/harness/deerflow/agents/lead_agent/prompt.py` E501 行阻断；
  本轮未改该文件。独立 code-reviewer 复审后结论为 APPROVE。
- 真实隔离 L1：根 Run `e9d79151…` success（11 次 LLM、115,011 tokens、约
  6 分 28 秒）；唯一 task `call_FklOfoDZciJvAbeER4OhyWfx` 产生唯一
  result_seq 249，唯一 wake `6f372561…` success（attempts=1、30 次 LLM、
  963,087 tokens、约 12 分 16 秒）。卡与 DECK 为单卡收敛，派发/采用各 1，
  ack 至 249，Run 错误字段为空且未出现运行时 GraphRecursionError。
- 不把时序差异掩盖为通过：Chair 完成报告生成时读取到
  `notified_through_seq=0`；wake 结束后实际 `result.inbox.notified` 事件写入
  through_seq=249。故本轮证明入口预算语义与单卡链路成功，但不将严格
  `ack/notified/report` 一致性、总体稳定、自动恢复、exactly-once、并行可用
  或委派增益写成已证明；原定 L2 继续暂缓，交 Owner 讨论。
- 仅重启本地 Gateway 加载代码。真实链路使用既有本地会话并访问模型提供方；
  Gateway 启动时已有 Feishu 渠道建立连接，但未发送 Feishu 或任何外部消息；
  未暴露秘密，未产生生产或业务写入。运行只写入本地隔离线程/工作区数据；
  未 commit、push、reset 或清理既有 dirty worktree。

## 2026-07-22 — NextOS 2.0 Round 003-B L2 三卡并发与结果合流

  completion，三 receipt 早于最早完成的并发门不成立。仅 003B-03
  收敛采用（adoption_count=1）；003B-01 因 child `/mnt` 输入不可用、003B-02
  因 AGENTS 边界冲突停止，均未补派、重试或补造 evidence。
- ack 事件覆盖 through_seq=258；wake success 后 post-run
  `result.inbox.notified` 亦覆盖 through_seq=258。完成报告在隔离工作区
  `rounds/003-b/Round-003B-完成报告.md`，并已追加独立只读 notified 审计。
- 未修改代码、测试、Prompt、Skill、角色映射、配置、服务或既有 worktree；
  未重启服务、未发送外部消息、未接触生产/客户/支付/凭据，未暴露敏感信息。

## 2026-07-23 — NextOS 2.0 Round 003-C 三任务批量 fan-out 回归

- 在隔离 thread `3a8d9095-3a1c-4704-8e94-bfcb09fad16a` 执行，最终
  判定 **PASS**。根 Run `b846311b-7d53-459e-aaa0-7710478f0dc4`
  的 `llm.ai.response` seq 193 恰有三条 `task()`，分别对应
  003C-01/02/03，且没有混入其他工具。
- 三条 durable receipt 均在 `16:40:34Z` 写入，最晚 receipt 比最早
  child terminal 早约 31.509 秒；三条 lane 从同一毫秒启动并真实重叠。
  三个 fact-finder 均使用注入的 host Workspace 读取自己的 fixture，
  返回完整 L2 证据，结果序号为 267/268/266，各采用一次，无串线、
  重派、重复采用或未归属 child 工件。
- 唯一 wake ID `c6423bda-bf45-4a08-91c6-0aaade24cf0b`、Run
  `8cb6bba8-598a-4d61-96a6-9fe5d064240d` 成功合批 266–268；ack revision
  270 与 post-run notified revision 271 均覆盖 268。根 Run 与 wake 均
  success，未出现 `GraphRecursionError` 或 terminal error。
- 两个 Chair Run 账本合计 21 次 LLM、471,227 tokens，从根 Run 创建到
  wake 终止约 10 分 09.641 秒；child 内部若无独立用量账则不混算。
- 外部审计已追加到 `rounds/003-c/Round-003C-完成报告.md`。另观察到
  `write_file` 会把卡片正文里的 literal `/mnt/user-data/workspace` 展开为
  host path；实际 task prompt 未被改写且本轮路径正确。历史工件保留原样，
  该现象只登记为后续研究，本轮未改代码、Prompt、Skill、角色、配置或服务。
- 未重启服务、未发送外部消息、未接触生产/客户/支付/凭据，未
  commit/push/reset/clean；下一轮未创建或激活。

## 2026-07-23 — NextOS 2.0 Round 003-D0 载体正文保真谱系审计

- 只读审计 003-C 隔离 thread `3a8d9095-…` 根 Run `b846311b-…` 与 wake
  `8cb6bba8-…` 的 JSONL journal、当前源码与磁盘字节。未改代码、测试、
  Prompt、Skill、角色、配置、服务、运行工件或历史记录;未启动任何 Run。
- 冻结根 Run seq 170 的 8 个与 wake seq 313 的 1 个 `write_file` 原始
  content(SHA-256 入档),与 seq 184–191 首次回读逐字 diff:Brief 与三张
  卡各有 1 处正文变异,literal `/mnt/user-data/workspace` 被展开为 host
  Workspace(各 +135 字节);DECK 与 fixtures 仅末尾换行差异。
- fixture 磁盘字节 93/93/94 与原始写入逐字节一致,证明无虚拟路径的内容
  写入保真;末尾换行差异定位为 `read_file_tool` 行切片(sandbox/tools.py:1773)
  的读取侧展示工件。
- 首个可证变异边界唯一确认:`LocalSandbox.write_file` 中
  `_resolve_paths_in_content(content)`(local_sandbox.py:453,解析器 :291,
  正则 :114)。回读暴露改写是因 `expose_host_paths=True`
  (config.yaml:983 `unrestricted_host_access: true`)使
  `_reverse_resolve_paths_in_output` 原样返回(local_sandbox.py:255-256)。
- 影响面判定:`write_file.content` 与 `str_replace` 已证受影响(共用同一面,
  str_replace 另有 old_str 匹配不到已改写内容的陷阱);Goal Workspace body、
  task prompt、child result 已证未受程序改写影响(DB/透传证据)。
- 语义后果为真实反转:卡片「不要假设虚拟兼容路径物理存在」被改成
  「不要假设 host Workspace 物理存在」,非等价显示。
- 诊断全文见知识库 [[Round 003-D0 载体正文保真诊断]];按 PLAN 路线规则,
  下一路线候选为 D1(单点修复+一张卡跨 Run 保真回归),方案未写、未授权;
  本轮在诊断、Progress 与 log 同步后停止。

## 2026-07-23 — NextOS 2.0 Round 003-D1 载体正文保真修复

- 最小根因修复完成：`LocalSandbox.write_file`/`read_file` 不再改写正文，
  文本读写显式使用 UTF-8 与 `newline=""`；退役正文路径缓存/实例状态。
  bash 命令面路径解析、输出遮蔽、glob/grep、上传下载、provider 缓存、
  LRU、并发和 release 行为不变。工具 docstring 明确正文不做路径翻译，
  可执行内容优先相对路径或通过 bash argv 传路径。
- 六处既定测试覆盖 `expose_host_paths` 两态、fresh instance、append、
  literal `/mnt/...` 的 `str_replace`、schema 契约、CRLF/raw bytes 与
  两个文本 `open()` 的 `newline=""`。复跑结果为 220 + 28 = 248 passed；
  scoped Ruff check/format、`git diff --check`、退役符号扫描通过。全仓
  `make lint` 仍仅有既存三处 `lead_agent/prompt.py` E501。
- 执行期 Opposition 无实质路线冲突；独立 python-reviewer 与
  code-reviewer 均无 D1 有效问题。
- D1-01 thread `d1-01-e270c62e-55d9-4193-b76a-f5d068857e17` 的实现和
  双 Run 行为证据保留，但因初始磁盘 SHA 未在替换前冻结，原样记为
  `STOPPED_PARTIAL`，不洗历史。
- D1-02 thread `d1-02-765bf1fc-18fa-4a8a-8a36-46523f5fcb82` 的有效
  Run 1 `ff79fa2a-9e51-4978-b5ba-08df9f0ba6a7` success（15 LLM、
  143,361 tokens、163.531 秒）。初始 journal seq 50、磁盘 seq 56、
  完整回读 seq 59 均为 78 bytes / SHA-256
  `84ddeda534f763b6a2410a83c3c506e90cfc2b2a66ae23596250dd6347537022`。
  literal `/mnt/...` 替换后为 63 bytes / `97c40a7ac9231982…`；追加
  `append:D1-02\n`（13 bytes）后的 seq 74/77 与 host 磁盘均为
  76 bytes / SHA-256
  `0f42ab4e9fd0c4c3f5f0aea644bee1f7f6010ced4ad35f02b2504ff7e0b92ee0`。
- 一次收到 meta 指令的误跑
  `df0783a0-06e5-4ca7-9770-d904cc0c69b0` 被排除：只做只读源码/本地端口/
  HTTP GET 探查，未调用写工具或修改卡片；22 LLM、564,808 tokens、
  527.094 秒不计入有效双 Run。
- 有效 Run 2 `58fad81b-1af9-4d39-a65c-bba6ca08304b` success（3 LLM、
  47,163 tokens、87.104 秒），journal 只有 seq 4193 一次无切片
  `read_file`，返回 76 bytes，SHA-256 与 Run 1 末态和 host 磁盘严格
  一致。事实脚本严格口径不一致项为 0。
- bash 直接 `cat /mnt/...` 与 argv-only 脚本均成功输出 fixture。最终
  AI 判定：正文保真成立、bash 执行面未回归、#1778 argv 解法可行。
- 实现阶段在 0 活动 Run 后只重启过本地 Gateway；D1-02 收证未重启服务。
  未访问生产、未发送外部消息、未暴露秘密；有效 Run 使用既有模型服务，
  临时 Chrome 只产生常规 Google updater/GCM 后台请求。未 commit、未 push；
  D1 已归档并停止，没有自动进入 Round 004。

## 2026-07-23 — 前端重整第一刀(tokens+会话主界面)与治理态恢复

- 前端第一刀(`37bcfac9`):深色效率工具风 tokens 落 globals.css(四层表面、电蓝强调、状态四色、JetBrains Mono token、8px 圆角),根 layout 默认 dark;拆 message-list.tsx(1822→1413,出 utils/scroll-controller/load-more-indicator)与 input-box.tsx(1654→1472,出 utils/suggestion-list/add-attachments-button);重皮 sidebar(密度+active 蓝条+状态色)、40px 顶栏、坞式 composer、用户消息左侧角色条全宽化、task 卡状态色。831 单测全绿,不动数据层与 ai-elements 生成组件。
- 体验修正:to-dos 面板白底改主题色并调为 5 行高(`ae5e71b4`/`e4c75ce2`);新建会话 404 修复(`cc4fa1b2`,`useThreadStream` 入口把字面 "new" 归一为 undefined,根治 POST /threads/new/history 的 unhandledRejection)。
- Round 003-A 递归预算修复重建(`b4f8aeda`):cleanup 丢失后按 Progress 语义重实现,command-room 默认 1000/显式优先/普通 100,新增 3 个回归测试。
- 07-23 cleanup 丢失的 NextOS 2.0 治理态自 codex 会话恢复(`54b5a424`):planner 角色移除、委派纪律(Chair 只读自查、task 只派真独立活)、MCP 对 command-room 开放、server_error 归瞬时重试、prompt 刷新稿、probe 脚本、skillopt、2.0 蓝图文档;重申 planner skill 与 update-card 删除(`30c4ce76` 补齐配套)。
- 验证:438 后端聚焦测试、前端全量单测、typecheck、eslint/prettier、ruff 全绿;pre-existing 3 条 E501(prompt.py)顺带清除。
- 未 push;Gateway 旧进程(09:44 启)仍为内存中旧代码,重启后生效已提交状态。

## 2026-07-23 — 前端第二刀与 turbopack 事件

- 第二刀:agents 页密度(8cc634ca)、设置页蓝条导航(3b0ce21e)、landing hero 效率化(49374e7a)。
- WordRotate 弃 framer-motion 改纯 React+CSS(轮转词此前冻结在 SSR 初始态)。
- **turbopack dev 故障**:重启后 hero 动画/FlickeringGrid/login 切换全部冻结在 SSR 初始态,webpack 模式正常。dev 脚本已改 `next dev --webpack`(03ff1fbf)。旧 13 天 turbo server 的 .next 缓存也是旧 tokens 的来源。
- 全在本地 commit,未 push;Gateway 仍待拼多多 thread 完成后重启。

## 2026-07-23 — NextOS 五个人门与取消结果交付修复

- Command Room 活提示词统一为五个人门：目标/价值优先级/非目标变化，架构/运行方式/工作流/路线实质变化，当前意图无法裁决的重大取舍，新增真实外部/不可逆/敏感权限，或 Owner 明确要求评审；删除运行时“四个人门”并行表述。
- 普通 child 取消现在被记录为 `cancelled` 终态，经既有 `RESULT_RECEIVED`、TaskLane 与 Chair wake 链路传递；Gateway 关闭期间仍保留原有停止语义。
- 回归：`tests/test_command_room_background.py` 增加取消结果交付、通知及 Chair wake 覆盖；`tests/test_command_room_goal_first.py` 与 `tests/test_lead_agent_prompt.py` 固定五门措辞。聚焦 47 passed；Command Room 套件 95 passed、2 skipped。
- 未访问生产或外部系统、未暴露凭据、未 push；Gateway 重启和运行时复验待本次本地改动后执行。

- 完整本地验证：相关 Command Room/提示词/角色/子任务传输套件 `147 passed, 2 skipped`，Ruff 检查与格式检查通过；`/Users/pingxia/Documents/NextOS make check-all`（合同与静态 SkillOpt）通过。随后以规范 daemon 脚本重启本地 Gateway，Gateway 健康端点、代理和前端均为 HTTP 200。
- 第 1 组 A/B 复验：A thread `2db7f155-…` 精确派出 1 个 executor，B thread `a54cec0f-…` 精确派出 2 个独立 executor；三条 child 都为 `completed`。A 的 child 用时 420,381ms，B 两条用时 256,327ms 与 414,434ms。每个终态均有 `result.received`、Chair wake、`result.inbox.acknowledged` 与 `result.inbox.notified` 事实；未出现自动验收或程序推进。
- 复验 Chair token 小计：A 126,652（2 个 Chair Run），B 253,094（3 个 Chair Run）。child token 字段仍为 0，故本轮不把成本做可比结论；A/B 也未做盲评，不能由这组推断质量优势。实际取消→结果→wake 的分支由新增后台服务回归覆盖，且取消恢复路径也有覆盖。
- 运行时审计子结果确认：活动 prompt 只有明确五个人门；取消事实、`RESULT_RECEIVED`、TaskLane 与 Chair wake 是可恢复的独立事实链，`RESULT_RECEIVED` 追加失败时 lane outcome 仍是回退传输依据。未访问生产或外部系统、未暴露凭据、未 push。
- 第 2 组 A/B（child token 账本只读调查）完成：A thread `0eff7e4c-…` 精确派出 1 个 executor（628,645ms），B thread `a05ca9f1-…` 精确派出 2 个独立 executor（263,490ms、318,422ms）；三条均为 `completed`，每条都有 `result.received`、acknowledged 与 Chair wake/notified。证据一致：`codex_cli.py` 只以 `--output-last-message` 接收最终文本、丢弃 stdout；`task_tool.py` 的完成事件固定 `usage: None`，TaskLane 无 token 字段，且该路径不调用外部 usage 聚合。因此已完成 child 的 token 仍为 0，child 成本不可比较，不能估算补齐。A Chair token 小计 226,879（2 Run），B 为 361,537（3 Run），仅作事实记录。
- 第 3 组 A/B（账本方案反方，只读）完成：A thread `6b7a80b5-…` 精确派出 1 个 executor（327,659ms），B thread `d5a6f4ab-…` 在同一批精确派出 2 个独立 executor（295,177ms、383,383ms）；三条均成功，均有 `result.received`、acknowledged 与 Chair wake/notified。三方独立确认：本机 `codex exec --help` 只证明 `--json` 会输出 JSONL，不证明事件含稳定 usage schema；当前 transport 未启用/读取 JSONL、stdout 为 DEVNULL，完成事件仍为 `usage: null`。结论保持 child 成本不可比较；JSONL 仅是需单独验证和评审的候选，未实施改动。A Chair token 小计 489,109（2 Run），B 为 371,358（3 Run）；两线均约 12 分钟结束，child token 仍为 0，不能以该字段比较成本。
- 隔离 JSONL 兼容性探针：在 `/private/tmp` 以 `codex exec --ephemeral --json --skip-git-repo-check --sandbox read-only` 运行固定无工具提示词；真实 `turn.completed` JSONL 事件包含 `usage.input_tokens`、`cached_input_tokens`、`cache_write_input_tokens`、`output_tokens`、`reasoning_output_tokens`。这证明本机 Codex CLI `0.145.0` 可观测到 usage，但尚未形成跨版本稳定契约；未读项目、未改仓库或服务。任何把该观察接入 transport/Run Ledger/TaskLane 的改造仍须单独评审。

## 2026-07-23 — Codex child token 最小账本桥接

- 按已确认的最小范围接入：Codex CLI 启用 JSONL，仅从 `turn.completed.usage` 提取非负 `input_tokens` 与 `output_tokens`；最终自然语言结果仍只读取既有 `--output-last-message` 文件。未扩展 TaskLane、任务事件、API 或 UI。
- 前台 child 进入既有 `RunJournal.record_external_llm_usage_records` 与 AI attribution cache；Command Room 后台 child 通过运行时注入的回调原子回写其 source Run Ledger。SQL/内存账本均以 `codex-cli:{task_id}` 去重，并处理源 Run 完成与 child 回写并发的合并，不改变任务结果或 Chair wake 事实链。
- 审查补齐了「后台无 Journal writer」仍必须回写 source Run 的边界；Ruff 通过，聚焦 `213 passed`、Command Room/账本回归 `125 passed`，最终后端全量 `uv run pytest -q` 完成无失败。两次均以 `./scripts/serve.sh --restart --dev --daemon --skip-install` 重启本地栈；最终 Gateway `/health`、Nginx `:2026` 与本次 frontend `:6001` 均为 200。未访问生产、未暴露凭据、未 push。
- 真实 field 验证：用户在本地 Command Room thread `f556596e-…` 发起单个 executor `LEDGER_PROBE`；source Run `75017632-…` success，TaskLane `call_b5ORyZYnX87Vke6h5WYgh0sJ` completed。Run Ledger 记录 `subagent_tokens=30,080`，模型分桶 `gpt-5.6-terra` 为 input `30,071`、output `9`、total `30,080`；总账 `56,523 = lead 26,158 + subagent 30,080 + middleware 285`，一致。TaskLane 未新增 token 字段，符合本次边界。
- 本次相关改动已提交并推送至个人 `share/main`：`86e14d4c feat(nextos): record codex child token usage`。未推送上游 `origin`；保留用户已有的 `scripts/skillopt-probe.sh` 与 `skillopt/` 未跟踪内容，不纳入提交。
